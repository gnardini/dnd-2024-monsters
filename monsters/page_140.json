Each time the gorgon enters a creatureâ€™s space for the first time during this move, that target is subjected to the following effect. <i>Dexterity Saving Throw:</i> DC 16. <i>Failure:</i> 13 (2d8 + 4) Piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) Fire damage, and the target is pulled into the gorgon's space and has the Grappled condition (escape DC 14); if the gorgon already has a creature Grappled, the target has the Prone condition instead. Until the grapple ends, the target has the Restrained condition. When the gorgon moves, the Grappled target moves with it, costing no extra movement."
