If the target is a creature and doesn’t already have an infernal wound, it is subjected to the following effect. <i>Constitution Saving Throw:</i> DC 12. Failure: The target receives an infernal wound. While wounded, the target loses 5 (1d10) Hit Points at the start of each of its turns. The wound closes after 1 minute, after a spell restores Hit Points to the target, or after the target or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to stanch the wound, doing so by succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check."
