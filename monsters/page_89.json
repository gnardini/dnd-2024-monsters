It can’t use this trait if it has the Incapacitated condition.<br><b>Displacement.</b> Attack rolls against the displacer beast have Disadvantage, since it projects an illusion that makes it appear to be near its actual location. This trait is suppressed while the displacer beast has the Incapacitated condition.",
