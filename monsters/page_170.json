While there, the intellect devourer has Total Cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; its understanding of Deep Speech; its telepathy; and its Detect Intelligence trait. It otherwise adopts the target’s game statistics. It knows everything the target knew, including spells and languages.<br>If the host body dies, the intellect devourer must leave it. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a <i>Wish</i> spell. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies unless its brain is restored before the end of the intellect devourer’s next turn."
