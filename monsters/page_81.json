Its Speed becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to its Speed, and it moves with the target.<br><br>A creature can take an action to try to detach the darkmantle from itself, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself by using 5 feet of movement.<br><br><strong>Darkness Aura (1/Day).</strong> Magical Darkness fills a 15-foot Emanation originating from the darkmantle.
