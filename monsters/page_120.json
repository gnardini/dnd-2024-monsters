    "actions": "<b>Pseudopod.</b> <i>Melee Attack:</i> +4, reach 5 ft. <i>Hit:</i> 12 (3d6 + 2) Acid damage.</p><p><b>Engulf.</b> The cube moves up to its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks. The cube can move through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has room inside itself to contain them (see the Ooze Cube trait). <i>Dexterity Saving Throw:</i> DC 12, each creature whose space the cube enters for the first time during this move. <i>Failure:</i> 10 (3d6) Acid damage, and the target is engulfed. An engulfed target is suffocating, can't cast spells with a Verbal component, has the Restrained condition, and takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space. <i>Success:</i> Half damage, and the target moves to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cube. If there is no unoccupied space, the target falls prone instead."
